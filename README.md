# Seismic Wave Propagation - Simulations and Analysis

In this repository, we simulate the propagation of seismic waves within the **Seismic Tomography** geophysical imaging technique. 

This repository contains scripts to simulate the 2D **Wave** and **Helmholtz** equations using **Finite Differences**.

We employ on the one hand the [**Devito**](https://www.devitoproject.org/) Python package to perform the simulations and on the other hand a custom framework developed for solving the linear system of finite differences.
